# Contributing to nysOpenData

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **nysOpenData**! This
package provides convenient R helpers for working with NYS Open Data
(Socrata) datasets and returns results as tidy tibbles with optional
filtering, sorting, and row limits.

This guide explains how to report issues, propose changes, and submit
pull requests.

## Filing Issues

Please open an issue with:

If the issue is dataset-specific, include:

- The dataset name and/or NYS Open Data dataset ID (e.g., `28gk-bu58`).
- Any filters used in the function call.
